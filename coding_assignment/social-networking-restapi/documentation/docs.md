# Tasks

###### Register a short-lived token on the fictional Social Network REST API

###### Fetch the posts of fictional users on a fictional social platform and process their posts.

###### You will have 1000 posts over a six month period.

###### Create a simple modern application in React or VueJS or their derivatives (NextJS for example is fine) which displays the 1000 posts in a paginated format. Please note, we will not be evaluating any design.

###### Create a dashboard for each user showing some or all of the following: a. The number of posts each person made in total

- The number of posts each person made in total
- Average number of characters of their posts
- The number of posts each person made every month
- Each personâ€™s longest post.

###### Design your thinking and code to be generic, extendable, easy to maintain by other staff members while thinking about performance
